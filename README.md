# Unit Testing 101

## Lesson 1: Let's write our first unit tests

In lesson 1, you will write some unit tests for Stringie, a library to transform strings. Stringie developers heard about unit testing and wrote "something" like unit tests.

In this lesson, you will write 2 or 3 unit tests for one of the Stringie methods. This lesson will teach you how to organize your tests in a solution and how to name your test projects, classes and methods.

**[Begin Lesson 1](Lesson1/README.md)**.

## Lesson 2: Let's fix some tests

In lesson 2, you will have to fix some unit tests. This time, Stringie developers wrote some unit tests, but they made some mistakes along the way. They forgot to use a naming convention, among other things.

In this lesson, you will have to fix the tests Stringie developers wrote.

**[Begin Lesson 2](Lesson2/README.md)**.
